    "query": "Hello Marwin, I am asked to create a table containing count of applications that were submitted and Approved by Months in the year. Can you please help me find the schemas that I could query\u00a0and\u00a0also\u00a0get me started with a SQL query?",
    "answer": "To create a table containing the count of applications that were submitted and approved by month, you will be querying the `fact_applications` table in the `cwc` database.\n\nThe relevant columns you will need are:\n- `date_actioned`: This column contains the date and time when the application was reviewed and submitted with a final outcome; it will help you group by month.\n- `outcome_id`: This column indicates the outcome of the application. You will specifically want to filter for applications that were approved (outcome ID 'A').\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SQL query to count the number of approved applications by month:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    DATE_FORMAT(date_actioned, '%Y-%m') AS month,\n    COUNT(app_id) AS approved_count\nFROM \n    cwc.fact_applications\nWHERE \n    outcome_id = 'A'\nGROUP BY \n    month\nORDER BY \n    month;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL Query:\n- `DATE_FORMAT(date_actioned, '%Y-%m')`: This formats the `date_actioned` datetime into a string representing the year and month (e.g., '2023-01').\n- `COUNT(app_id)`: This counts the number of unique application IDs that were approved.\n- `FROM cwc.fact_applications`: This specifies the table we are querying from.\n- `WHERE outcome_id = 'A'`: This filters the results to only include approved applications.\n- `GROUP BY month`: This groups the results by the formatted month string so that we get a count per month.\n- `ORDER BY month`: This orders the results by month in a chronological order.\n\nFeel free to modify the query according to your specific requirements or data representation!\n\nIf you have any further questions about SQL or need assistance with anything else related to data or metadata, just let me know!",

    "answer": "To count the number of applications that were withdrawn per queue name per month of the year, you will need to query both the `fact_applications` and `dim_queue` tables in the `cwc` database.\n\nHere are the details you'll need:\n\n1. **`fact_applications` table**:\n   - **Column**: `outcome_id` (to filter for withdrawn applications, with outcome ID 'W').\n   - **Column**: `date_actioned` (to group by month).\n\n2. **`dim_queue` table**:\n   - **Column**: `queue_id` (to join with the fact applications for the queue name).\n   - **Column**: `queue_name` (to select the name of the queue).\n\nHere\u2019s a sample SQL query to count the number of withdrawn applications per queue name per month:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    dq.queue_name,\n    DATE_FORMAT(fa.date_actioned, '%Y-%m') AS month,\n    COUNT(fa.app_id) AS withdrawn_count\nFROM \n    cwc.fact_applications AS fa\nJOIN \n    cwc.dim_queue AS dq ON fa.queue_id = dq.queue_id\nWHERE \n    fa.outcome_id = 'W'\nGROUP BY \n    dq.queue_name, month\nORDER BY \n    dq.queue_name, month;\n```\n\n### Explanation of the SQL Query:\n- **`dq.queue_name`**: This selects the name of the queue.\n- **`DATE_FORMAT(fa.date_actioned, '%Y-%m')`**: This formats the date_actioned into year and month for grouping.\n- **`COUNT(fa.app_id)`**: This counts the number of withdrawn applications.\n- **`FROM cwc.fact_applications AS fa`**: Specifies the applications table with an alias `fa`.\n- **`JOIN cwc.dim_queue AS dq ON fa.queue_id = dq.queue_id`**: Joins with the queue table to get queue names.\n- **`WHERE fa.outcome_id = 'W'`**: Filters to include only withdrawn applications.\n- **`GROUP BY dq.queue_name, month`**: Groups the results by queue name and month for proper aggregation.\n- **`ORDER BY dq.queue_name, month`**: Orders the results by queue name and month in ascending order.\n\nFeel free to adjust the query as necessary for your needs or let me know if you have any questions regarding SQL or data!",

    "query": "and what does cwc database store? tell me what I can use it for and qhat possible KPIs that we come uyp with given the details of cwc database and the tables it stores.",
    "answer": "The CWC database stores information related to applications received by a credit and lending organization. The primary purpose of this database is to manage applications from consumers, including their outcomes and the workflow associated with those applications. Here are some details about what the CWC database contains and how you can utilize it:\n\n### Key Tables and Their Purposes:\n\n1. **`fact_applications`**: \n   - Stores details of all applications received, their outcomes, dates and times of submission and review, comments from the credit insight team, and identifiers for stores, queues, and analysts involved.\n\n2. **`dim_store`**: \n   - Contains information about CWC stores and partners, including unique identifiers and store names.\n\n3. **`dim_queue`**: \n   - Lists different queues under which applications are received. This includes various categories of consumers, such as existing consumers and those in different stages of the credit review process.\n\n4. **`sla_vw`**: \n   - A view that likely aggregates or presents metrics related to service level agreements (SLA) for the applications processed.\n\n### Possible Uses of the CWC Database:\n\n- **Application Tracking**: Monitor the flow of applications through the system, from submission to outcome, identifying bottlenecks or delays in processing.\n- **Outcome Analysis**: Analyze the approval and rejection rates of applications, distinguishing between different consumer types or queues.\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure the performance of different stores, queues, and analysts by tracking metrics related to application processing.\n- **Consumer Insights**: Understand consumer behavior based on application outcomes and the types of applications received to tailor services accordingly.\n\n### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) You Can Derive:\n\n1. **Application Approval Rate**: The percentage of applications that are approved versus those submitted.\n2. **Average Processing Time**: The average time taken from application submission to final outcome.\n3. **Decline Rate**: The percentage of applications that are declined, potentially broken down by consumer type or store.\n4. **Volume of Applications by Month**: The number of applications received monthly, which can help in resource allocation and trend analysis.\n5. **Outcome Distribution by Queue**: The distribution of outcomes (approved, declined, withdrawn) categorized by different queues to assess which consumer segments perform better.\n6. **Comments Analysis**: Assessment of common comments made by analysts during reviews, which can provide insights into frequent issues or areas needing improvement.\n\n### SQL Query Examples:\n\nHere are a few examples of SQL queries you could use to derive these KPIs:\n\n**1. To calculate the application approval rate:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN outcome_id = 'A' THEN app_id END) AS approved_count,\n    COUNT(app_id) AS total_count,\n    (COUNT(CASE WHEN outcome_id = 'A' THEN app_id END) / COUNT(app_id)) * 100 AS approval_rate\nFROM \n    cwc.fact_applications;\n```\n\n**2. To find the average processing time by month:**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    DATE_FORMAT(date_actioned, '%Y-%m') AS month,\n    AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, date_submitted, date_actioned)) AS avg_processing_time\nFROM \n    cwc.fact_applications\nGROUP BY \n    month;\n```\n\nThese queries can be adjusted according to specific reporting needs.\n\nIf you have specific reports or metrics you wish to focus on within the CWC database, please let me know, and I can provide more targeted assistance!",
